# EMHD Shock problem
# Try to maintain the BVP solution to a discontuinity
# Checks the higher order terms implementation in flat space
# IMPORTANT: This test is different from the other tests in its initialization
#            It reads in ".txt" files that correspond to the BVP solution (set input to "BVP" in <emhdshock>)
#            One, in principle, can run this problem with the usual ideal MHD jump conditions but this
#            may not allow a quantitative check
#            Run it with a single MPI task
