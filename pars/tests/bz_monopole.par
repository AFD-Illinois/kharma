# Monopole in vacuum
# Useful for testing floor values, since the whole domain will be
# set to whatever the floor values are

# The current values are very conservative, try it with `fofc/on=true`
# and remove the ceiling on sigma to exercise KHARMA a bit more.
# Hard mode: gamma=5/3, weno5 reconstruction
