/**
 * Root finder macro for X[2] since it is sometimes not analytically invertible
 * Written with a common interface for doing 2D solves, if those are ever required
 * 
 * TODO ASSUMES Xnative bounds are [0,1] and Xembed bounds are [0,M_PI]!!!!!
 * TODO I cannot find a remotely simple way to do this with templates or function pointers:
 *      if this is taken out of the enclosing scope we need to resolve coord_to_embed, which is haaaard
 * 
 * Takes names Xembed (filled, not modified), Xnative (filled, modifies X[2]), and calls function coord_to_embed
