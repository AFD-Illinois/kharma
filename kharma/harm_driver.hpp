/**
 * A Driver object orchestrates everything that has to be done to a mesh to constitute a step.
 * For HARM, this means the predictor-corrector steps of fluid evolution.
 * 
 * Unlike MHD, GRMHD has two independent sets of variables: the conserved variables, and a set of
 * "primitive" variables more amenable to reconstruction.  To evolve the fluid, the conserved
 * variables must be:
 * 1. Transformed to the primitives
 * 2. Reconstruct the right- and left-going components at zone faces
 * 3. Transform back to conserved quantities and calculate the fluxes at faces
 * 4. Update conserved variables using the divergence of conserved fluxes
 * 
 * (for higher-order schemes, this is more or less just repeated and added)
 *
 * iharm3d (and the ImEx driver) put step 1 at the bottom, and syncs/fixes primitive variables
 * between each step.  This driver runs through the steps as listed, applying floors after step
 * 1 as iharm3d does, but syncing the conserved variables.
