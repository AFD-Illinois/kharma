 * 
 * Returns a code indicating whether the solver converged (success), failed (max_iter), or
 * indicating that the converged solution was unphysical (bad_ut, neg_rhou, neg_rho, neg_u)
 * 
 * On error, will not write replacement values, leaving the previous step's values in place
 * These are fixed later, in FixUtoP

 * This is the function template: implementations are filled in in their own headers.
 * Be VERY CAREFUL to define any specializations by including those headers,
