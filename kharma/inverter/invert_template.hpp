 * Recover local primitive variables, with a one-dimensional Newton-Raphson iterative solver.
 * Iteration starts from the current primitive values, and otherwse may *fail to converge*
 * 
 * Returns a code indicating whether the solver converged (success), failed (max_iter), or
 * indicating that the converged solution was unphysical (bad_ut, neg_rhou, neg_rho, neg_u)
 * 
 * On error, will not write replacement values, leaving the previous step's values in place
 * These are fixed later, in FixUtoP
 * 
 * This is the function template: implementations are filled in in their own headers.
 * Be VERY CAREFUL to define any specializations by including those headers,
 * BEFORE you instantiate the template.
