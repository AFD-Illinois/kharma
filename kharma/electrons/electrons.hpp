 *
 * Adapted very closely from work done for iharm3d by Cesar Diaz
 *
 * This implementation doubles as a guide to writing packages for KHARMA -- the comments provide basic
 * explanations about how they interact with KHARMA as a whole.
 * Most package functions are either registered as callbacks at the end of Initialize() (for Parthenon)
 * or added to the functions in kharma.cpp (for KHARMA).  Be sure to register all your functions when
 * first creating a package!
