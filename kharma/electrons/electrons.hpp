 * entropy fed by some fraction of dissipation.
 * It supports running any/all of several heating models (dissipation fractions) via runtime parameters.
 *
 * Adapted very closely from work done for iharm3d by Cesar Diaz
 *
 * This implementation doubles as a guide to writing packages for KHARMA -- the comments provide basic
 * explanations about how they interact with KHARMA as a whole.
 * Most package functions are either registered as callbacks at the end of Initialize() (for Parthenon)
 * or added to the functions in kharma.cpp (for KHARMA).  Be sure to register all your functions when
 * first creating a package!

 * using each step's total dissipation (advected vs actual fluid entropy)
 * It applies any or all of several different esimates for this split, to each of the several different
 * primitive variables "prims.Kel_X"
 * Finally, it checks the results against a minimum and maximum temperature ratio T_protons/T_electrons

 * To recap re: floors:
 * This function expects two sets of values {rho0, u0, Ktot0} from rc_old and {rho1, u1} from rc,
 * all of which obey all given floors.
 * It produces end-of-substep values {Ktot1, Kel_X1, Kel_Y1, etc}, which are also guaranteed to obey floors
