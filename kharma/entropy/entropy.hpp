/**
 * This physics package tracks the fluid's total entropy Ktot, independent of any
 * package which might make use of it (e.g. Electrons, which splits the dissipation
 * it represents among several electron heating models).
 *
 * Ktot is advected as a normal passive scalar (see Flux::prim_to_flux) over the course
 * of a step, then reset at step end to the value implied by the real, current rho & u --
 * i.e., the entropy the fluid *actually* has, dissipation included.  The difference
 * between the pre-reset (purely advected, dissipation-free) value and this real value is
 * exactly the numerical dissipation incurred during the step -- see Ressler+ 2015 eq. 27
 * for the expression this generalizes, and Electrons::ApplyElectronHeating for a
 * consumer.
 *
 * Optionally (see "advect_entropy" below), this package also tracks a second, genuinely
 * idealized entropy, Ktot_adv, which is *never* reset: it is simply advected for the
 * entire run as if there had been no dissipation at all.
 *
 * NOTE Ktot and Ktot_adv are not the same kind of object, and are not directly
 * comparable:
 *
 *   Ktot     = (gam-1) u / rho^gam       specific entropy, per unit mass.
 *                                        Lagrangian invariant: u^mu d_mu Ktot = 0, so it
 *                                        advects weighted by the mass flux, and its
 *                                        conserved form is sqrt(-g) rho u^t Ktot.
 *
 *   Ktot_adv = (gam-1) u / rho^(gam-1)   entropy *density*, i.e. rho * Ktot.  This is
 *                                        Noble+ 2009 (arXiv:0808.3140) eq. 20, the
 *                                        variable used by their entropy-based
 *                                        primitive inversion scheme.
 *
 * The two conserved forms are numerically identical -- sqrt(-g) rho u^t Ktot ==
 * sqrt(-g) u^t (rho Ktot) -- which is why only the primitive normalization and the flux
 * expression differ between them.  The reason for carrying Ktot_adv in Noble's form
 * rather than as a second specific entropy is that the inversion wants p directly:
 * given rho, p = Ktot_adv * rho^(gam-1) with no root-find.
 *
 * Consequently the dissipation-free specific entropy is Ktot_adv/rho, and the
 * accumulated dissipation is Ktot - Ktot_adv/rho.
